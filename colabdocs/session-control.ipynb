    "When integrating PHP and React, one of the complexities involves coordinating session management and authentication between the server-side and client-side. PHP typically manages sessions on the server, whereas React manages the application's state in the client's browser. To effectively connect these two layers, developers often implement solutions like JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or OAuth. These methods provide a secure and smooth authentication process that facilitates communication between the PHP backend and the React frontend.\n",
