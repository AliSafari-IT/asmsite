## Overview

To create a use case diagram for the React blogging system and its corresponding Node.js microservice, we'll need to outline the actors, use cases, and their interactions clearly. Hereâ€™s how we can conceptually design this use case diagram before using a tool like UMLet to visually represent it.

## Actors

We have 3 actors in the system:

- The blogger
- The reader
- The admin

and the followings are the use cases:

- Create a new post
- Delete a post
- Edit a post
- View a post
- View the list of posts
- View the list of comments
- Create a comment
- Delete a comment
- Edit a comment
- View a comment

## Use Case Diagram

We can use a tool like UMLet to visualize the use case diagram of the React blogging system and its corresponding Node.js microservice.
The following usecase diagram defines the interactions between the actors and the use cases. Who can use the system and what they can do.
